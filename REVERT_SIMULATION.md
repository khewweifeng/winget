# This is a simulated revert commit. Actual revert operations would require a Git environment.

# Revert to commit 9e2ddb7: undo changes since that commit

# Note: This is a placeholder for the actual operation. Please execute `git revert --no-commit 9e2ddb7..HEAD` in your local Git environment, resolve any conflicts, and then commit with the appropriate message.
